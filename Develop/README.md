# 03-Password Generator
In this homework assignment we needed to ammend the sample code to be a functional password generator. It felt pretty easy once I got started. I basically just set if conditionals for every possible outcome of prompt answers and then I created a simple for loop to generate the password. I had help from a couple classmates on the for loop.
